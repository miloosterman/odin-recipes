    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Who can resist warm yeast rolls, fresh from the oven?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter OR margarine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 3/4 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 1/4 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces; shape into balls. Place in greased 8-inch round pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; brush with additional melted butter, if desired. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
